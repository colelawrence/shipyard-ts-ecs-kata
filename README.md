Two weeks ago, we began discussions about a new general programming paradigm, functional programming! I'm eager to now take everyone through another paradigm called "Data Oriented Design."

## TODO:

**Game over:**
If ball hits flag, then alert game over and close tab



**Add golf ball that follows flag pole**
Up to your imagination


**Randomize spawning of golf balls with random velocities**
Up to your imagination
